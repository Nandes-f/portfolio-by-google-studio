## Style Guidelines:

- Implement a sleek dark mode as the default, providing an aesthetically pleasing experience while reducing eye strain in low-light environments.
- Incorporate a vibrant accent color, #25CED1, to highlight key interactive elements such as buttons and navigation links. Also, use #E14D2A accent color to call-out urgent info and warnings.
- Maintain readable, sans-serif typography for headlines (xl size) and body text (base size) for optimal readability across devices.
- Use a set of modern icons for skills and technologies, creating a visually appealing, stylish and easy to read portfolio. These icons should adjust colors depending on the theme (light / dark).
- Utilize clean, uncluttered layouts to highlight the essential information on each screen. Adopt a minimalist approach, combining ample white space with well-organized sections to guide the user through Kian's experience.
- Incorporate subtle but smooth animations to add depth and polish. Focus on unobtrusive effects for scrolling transitions, button interaction, and content reveals that complement, rather than distract, the content.
