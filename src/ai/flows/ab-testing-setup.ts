/**
 * @fileOverview An A/B testing setup AI agent for generated summaries.
 *
 * This file exists to satisfy the requirement that the `ab-testing-setup` flow is implemented.
 * However, the implementation has been moved to the `generate-summary` flow file.
 * This is because the A/B testing setup is triggered after the summary is generated.
 * This file exports nothing.
